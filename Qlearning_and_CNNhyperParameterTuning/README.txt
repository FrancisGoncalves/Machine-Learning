Programming language and version: Python 3.9

For CNN problem, run: 'convNN.py'
For hyper parameter tuning code for the CNN problem, run: 'hyperParameterTuningLR.py' and 'hyperParameterTuningBS.py'

For Q-learning problem, run: 'eGreedy.py' and 'BoltzmannPolicy.py'

NOTE: The CNN code was ran on Google Colab and therefore is not meant to run on local GPU.
NOTE2: The MNIST dataset is downloaded from a built in function
